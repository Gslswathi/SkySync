### Description:
This project is a web-based application designed to provide users with real-time weather information for any city. It features a front-end interface where users can input the name of a city and submit a request to get the current weather data. The application sends this request to a backend server, built using Node.js, Axios and Express, which then fetches the relevant weather information from the OpenWeatherMap API. The server processes the data and returns it to the client, where it is displayed on the web page. The project combines HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality, creating an interactive and user-friendly experience. 
### Project Structure
- "index.html": HTML file for the front-end user interface.

- "styles.css": CSS file for styling the application.

- "index.js": Provides functionality for the application.

- "server.js": Node.js server script using Express and Axios to handle API requests.

- "package.json": Contains the dependencies that are needed for the application

- The html, css and javascript files used for the front-end of the application are inside the public folder.
